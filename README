jeer
=====================================================================

jeer is a (very, very) simple unit testing framework for JavaScript.


How to use jeer (with HTML - console support TBD)
=====================================================================

1. Include jeer.js and jeer.css in an HTML file of your creation.

2. Create a function that will be executed when that page is loaded
    (You can use $(function() { ... }) in jQuery, 
    or window.addEventListener('load', function() { ... }, false))
    or any other method you like)

3. Write some tests to be executed


How to write tests
=====================================================================

Tests in jeer belong to a group. You start a group with:

    tests("My Tests", function() {

		// Tests in here
		
    });

You write your tests inside that function with:

	test("1 + 1 = 2", function() {
		assertEqual(1 + 1, 2);
	});
	
	
Assertions
=====================================================================

jeer supports the following assertions:

    assertNull()
    assertNotNull()
    assertEqual()

and you can assert that anything is true by using the basic

    assert(boolean)


On the radar
=====================================================================

    Support v8 and print
    Support console.log
    Simple mocking
